## Project Overview
In this module, we worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. First, we learned how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, we created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

## Resources
For this project, we used data from the Citi Bike program in New York City. The data we downloaded was contained in a flat file, a CSV. We went to the Citi Bike System Data page. This link took us to an index of trip data, Download Citi Bike trip history data. We scrolled down the list to 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip, then downloaded and saved on our computer.

1. Data Source: [201908-citibike-tripdata.csv](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data),  [downloadable files of Citi Bike trip data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
2. Software: Tableau, Python (Using VS Code or Jupyter Notebook)

## Objectives
1. Import data into Tableau.
2. Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
3. Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
4. Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we put together our final presentation and analysis for investors. We selected the questions we wanted to answer, conducted independent research, crafted our story in Tableau, and then created our written analysis.

### Challenge Background:
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.


### Challenge Objectives
1. Deliverable 1
- Using Panda, create a code to convert the Tripduration datatyle from integer to DateTime format (e.g. 393 sec  ==> MM:SS format 1970-01-01 00:06:33) 
- [NYC_CitiBike_Challege.ipynb](https://github.com/SoonaBritney/Tableau_CitiBike/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)
- [Old CSV file](https://github.com/SoonaBritney/Tableau_CitiBike/blob/main/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb)
- [New CSV file - clould not upload to GitHub, since the file size is 169,667 MB](https://github.com/SoonaBritney/Tableau_CitiBike/edit/main/README.md)

2. Delieveble 2
- Import the new CSV (201908-citibike-tripdata_datetime.CSV) into Tableau 
- professionally and accurately visualize the worksheets in Tableau  
- There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour (10 pt)
- There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, and the graph can be filtered by the hour and gender (10 pt)
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week (10 pt)
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week, and the heatmap can be filtered by gender (10 pt)
- A heatmap is created showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week, and you can only filter by user and gender (10 pt)

3. Deliverable 3:
- Utilize previously created Tableau worksheets to create a new story.
- Create a Tableau story based on starting a bike-sharing company in Des Moines.

## Challenge Summary

For this portion of the presentation, I analyzed the data to answer core questions about opening a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.

Our goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. So we wanted to format our story so it was persuasive. We also wanted to include information about both New York City and Des Moinesâ€”after all, the investors will need to understand how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to our proposal.
